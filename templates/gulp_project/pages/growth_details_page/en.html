    <h1>Vaffle User Level</h1>

    <h2>What&#39;s the meaning of Vaffle User Level?</h2>

    <p>In the Vaffle community, people with different culture, life experiences, and values are sharing their vape
      knowledge, experience, and understanding in the communication. Based on consensus of the community, we
      intelligently identified and calculated the behavior of each Vaper, forming a Vaffle Uuser System consisting of
      three dimensions: &quot;Basic credit&quot;, &quot;Community contribution&quot;, and &quot;Compliance with
      conventions&quot;. The changes of levels will have different benefits and rights and will affect content
      recommendation and empower system. We hope this system can help every vaper understand community standards, make
      the community better, and improve user experience in the community.</p>

    <h2>User level and e-liquid value</h2>

    <p>When you register Vaffle as a new user, you will have a default level as a new vaper, if you want to be a
      high-level user in Vaffle, you need to collect enough e-liquid value. E-liquid value has different requirements at
      every different level, the higher user level needs more e-liquid value to achieve. The subsequent increase or
      decrease in the value of e-liquid is calculated cumulatively with the user&#39;s behavior and updated once a
      day.<br />The user&#39;s e-liquid value is comprehensively calculated from the three dimensions of &quot;Basic
      credit&quot;, &quot;Community contribution&quot;, and &quot;Compliance with standards&quot;. The index calculation
      principle for each dimension is as follows:</p>

    <h2>1. Basic Credit</h2>

    <p>Basic credit is an important part of e-liquid value, we will do the data summarization and empowerment
      calculations based on your account behavior in the community (completeness of personal information, history of
      personal account punishment), etc., to evaluate your index in the basic credit dimension to generate an e-liquid
      value.
      Which behavior may affect the Basic credit index?<br />Each ID corresponds to not only a Vaffle account but also a
      real person. Through the basic credit index, we encourage users to add their personal information and verify their
      emails as much as possible. At the same time, we encourage everyone to actively share e-cigarette-related
      information in the community and give honorary marks to the excellent answerers.<br />If your account information
      (including but not limited to the user name, avatar, personal signature, etc.) contains content that violates
      community standards, the violation information will be reset and your basic credit index will be reduced
      accordingly.<br />If your personal account gets banned, muted and other account-level penalties because of
      publishing illegal content, your basic credit index will also be reduced accordingly.</p>

    <h2>2. Community contribution index</h2>

    <p>The Community Contribution Index is a score that measures the contribution of users’ content creation. Vaffle
      encourages users to create high-quality original content. We will perform a qualitative evaluation of the quality
      algorithm model based on the content posted by each user, and then calculate the number of likes, comments, and
      repost, etc to export a score in the e-liquid value. </p>

    <h2>What behaviors will affect the community contribution index?</h2>

    <p>High-quality original content in the community is inseparable from the support of each creator. In order to
      maintain a good community atmosphere, we encourage everyone to share their knowledge, experience, and insights.
      Professional, credible, detailed, inspiring and high-quality content will not only be officially recommended and
      gain more users&#39; attention and support but will also be reflected in the improvement of the community
      contributions index. Specific standards include but are not limited to (<a href="https://m.vaffle.com/article/en/wOTeZn">for details, please refer to the Vaffle

      users.<br />● Positive feedback t other users, such as likes, comments, and reposts, will also help your community
      contributions index increase.<br />At the same time, we will lower the community contributions index,
      corresponding to these accounts for acts that may mislead other users and spread low-quality content such as
      pornography, vulgarity, violence, and repetition.</p>

    <h2>3. Compliance with community standards index</h2>

    <p>The &quot;Vaffle Community Standards&quot; restricts the behavior of each user in the community, and is also
      bottom-line protection; based on this regulation, intentional reduction of content quality and harm to the
      discussion atmosphere are intolerable by the community, and the content will be deleted or banned. Gradient
      penalties such as speech muted, ban, etc.; we comprehensively calculate the community standards index based on
      each Vaffle user’s community standards.</p>

    <h2>What actions will affect the community standards index?</h2>

      irregularities. To maintain your community standards index, please also avoid the following violations:<br />●
